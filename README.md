# Data and Code from the "Biology Meets Subduction" microbial diversity paper across the subduction zone of Costa Rica

This repository contains the raw data and the code used to analyze the interaction between the 16S rRNA microbial diversity and geochemistry across the hot spring of Costa Rica collected in the framework of the "Biology Meets Subductions" project, financed by the Deep Carbon Observatory and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

Data analyses have been performed using the freely available open source sfotware Mothur (https://www.mothur.org/) and the R Statistical Software [https://www.R-project.org/] (R development core team, 2010).

The preprint of the paper can be found on EarthXiv as preprint at www.
