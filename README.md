# Data and Code from the upcoming Microbial diversity paper across the subduction zones of Costa Rica

This repository contains the raw data and the code used to analyze the interaction between the 16S rRNA microbial diversity and geochemistry across the hot spring of Costa Rica collected in the framework of the "Biology Meets Subductions" project, financed by the Deep Carbon Observatory and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

Data analyses have been performed using the freely available open source (R Statistical Software)[https://www.R-project.org/] (R development core team, 2010).
